1. **Idea Submission** — describe an idea or upload documents; AI extracts, proposes, and checks consistency
2. **Feasibility Assessment** — AI scores readiness across 6 dimensions
3. **Gain–Pain Analysis** — AI scores benefit vs. risk across 8 dimensions
4. **Committee Decision** — governance board records Approve / Reject / Conditional / Defer
5. **Governance Dashboard** — portfolio-level visibility across all opportunities
6. **Expert Advice** — raise concerns or have an expert review and adjust scoring

# MODULE 1 — IDEA SUBMISSION
# ==========================

st.subheader("💡 Idea Submission")

st.markdown("""
Describe a business idea, problem statement, or use case in free text — and/or
upload supporting documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, TXT). The platform
walks through six steps:

1. **Describe** — type a description and/or attach files (multiple supported).
2. **Auto-Capture** — AI reads everything together and proposes a **Problem
   Statement** and **Business Objective**, which you can edit.
3. **Key Details** — you're asked directly for **Business Value**, **Workflow
   Location**, and **Decision Support**. The AI never invents these — vague
   answers (e.g. "TBD") won't be accepted for business value.
4. **Proposed Solution** — AI proposes a concrete solution type (e.g. Copilot,
   Predictive Analytics Platform, Agentic AI System) with expected benefits.
   If it's not right, answer a few targeted clarification questions and the
   AI will refine it — this can repeat until you're satisfied.
5. **Consistency Check** — if you uploaded documents, the platform compares
   what you typed against what the documents say, flagging any material
   contradictions with the exact file, page/slide/sheet, and confidence level.
6. **Review & Save** — confirm everything (including timeline, owner, and data
   sensitivity) before saving.

⚠️ Any contradictions flagged in Step 5 are saved alongside the submission so
the governance committee can see them during review.

# MODULE 2 — FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT
# ==========================

st.subheader("📊 Feasibility Assessment")

st.markdown("""
An AI Feasibility Analyst scores the submitted problem across **6
dimensions**, each from 1.0 to 5.0, applying the NIST AI RMF and ISO 42001:

| Dimension | What it evaluates |
|---|---|
| 🤖 AI Suitability | Pattern complexity, autonomy level, failure severity |
| 💰 Economic Viability | ROI, scale, budget, time-to-value |
| 🗄️ Data Readiness | Data availability, quality, bias risk, explainability |
| ⚙️ Workflow Maturity | Process stability, KPIs, human-in-the-loop integration |
| 👥 Change Management | Leadership support, user acceptance, training feasibility |
| ⚖️ Risk & Compliance | Regulatory compliance, ethical risk, audit trail, legal liability |

**Hard gate rules** — these override the overall average and force a
verdict regardless of how high other scores are:

* Data Readiness ≤ 2.0 → verdict is forced to **Not Feasible**
* Risk & Compliance ≤ 2.0 → verdict is forced to **Not Feasible**
* ISO Risk Category = **High** → a 0.3 penalty is applied to the overall average

**Verdict thresholds** (after gates and penalties):

* ✅ Average ≥ 3.5 → **Feasible**
* ⚠️ Average 2.5–3.49 → **Conditional**
* ❌ Average < 2.5 → **Not Feasible**

The AI also returns reasoning per dimension, strengths, risks, and
recommendations — review these rather than just the number.

# MODULE 3 — GAIN-PAIN ANALYSIS
# ==========================

st.subheader("⚖️ Gain–Pain Analysis")

st.markdown("""
Once a problem has been assessed, the AI scores it across **4 Gain
dimensions** and **4 Pain dimensions** (1.0–5.0 each):

**Gains** — 💰 Business Value · 🎯 Strategic Alignment · ⚡ Efficiency Gain · 🚀 Innovation Potential

**Pains** — 💸 Implementation Cost · ⚠️ Operational Risk · 🔄 Adoption Resistance · ⚖️ Compliance Burden

These combine into a single **Priority Score (0–10)**, banded as:

* 🟢 **High Priority** — pursue immediately
* 🟡 **Medium Priority** — schedule with conditions
* 🔴 **Low Priority** — defer or reconsider

The AI also surfaces **quick wins**, **mitigation actions**, and — where
evidence is thin — suggests which team (Technical, Marketing, Finance,
Legal/Compliance, HR) should be consulted before the score is finalized.

⚠️ **A note on trust:** these scores are an AI's qualitative judgment based
on the text you provided, not a deterministic calculation against
objective inputs. Treat the Priority Score as a starting point for
committee discussion, not a final verdict.

If a Gain-Pain score looks wrong, anyone can **raise a concern** here

* Review the original AI-generated scores and reasoning
* Adjust individual dimension scores with a documented reason
* Have the override applied and logged to the audit trail

This is the platform's built-in mechanism for catching AI scoring
mistakes — use it whenever a result doesn't match your own judgment.
